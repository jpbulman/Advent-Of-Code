# Advent of Code 2020!

This repository is dedicated to my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## About

I'm writing my solutions with NodeJS. I chose this because it has some really jank, but very short, ways of dealing with primitives and small operators. However, I have a feeling I may regret this later on when the complexity increases.

The `src` directory contains all of my solutions. Each requires a corresponding puzzle input `.txt` file. I've omitted my puzzle inputs with the `.gitignore`
